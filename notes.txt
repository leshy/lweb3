** DONE write tests for lweb!
** DONE replace internal subscriptionman with external one
** DONE make query closable and reply cancleable
** DONE make a remote subscription system based on query-replies
** DONE make some simple verbosing system
** TODO !!! what happens when a client disconnects? work on garbage collection across protocols
** DONE remote subscription system on top of the channel system?
** TODO server level channel subscriptions and collection definitions?
   keep internal things related to the communication seperated per client!
   query ids for example
** TODO reply timeouts
** TODO game intergration to lweb3
   so, in order to get game data you do a query
   which gives you the current state and then streams the changes - no permissions here.
   how do you interact? I guess just sends! - permissions here
